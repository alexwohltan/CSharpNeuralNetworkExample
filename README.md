# CSharpNeuralNetworkExample

I always wanted to develop my own implementation of a neural network to understand how they work and how they learn. There are many assets out there that explain the concept of neural networks and a ton of Python/R implementations. 
As the math is quite complex I wanted to build a neural network from scratch and put it into an object oriented structure, to understand how it really works (without 3rd-Party-Libraries). Most of the python implementations use Numpy and as a C# developer it sometimes takes some googling on what those functions are doing.
Therefore I built this example Neural Network in an object oriented structure. This code is not optimized for speed but rather for understanding the individual steps.
